# Mealie
A recipe manager for iOS

## Why???

This is mostly an exercise to teach me how to build an app from start to finish. My day job involves developing a framework, so am familiar with general Xcode development, unit testing, CI integeration, e.t.c. 

However, I lack knowledge of how an application is actually built and deployed. Testflight, Fastlane and analytics services such as Fabric, although common terms I hear used, are pretty alien to me. Additionally, the majority of the code written where I work is still in Objective-C. This project will be written exclusively in Swift, a language I really enjoy developing in and would like to get better at.
